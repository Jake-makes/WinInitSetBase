# WinInitSetBase
This scripts is meant to be run on each new windows installation 
by myself and anyone else who whishes it.

## What does it do
This script disables a few processes that are unnessecary if you do not use windows server integration,
it also disable windows logon and takes care of removing features that are better suited for POS devices.
The scripts also removes features that in my humble opinion should not come pre-installed such as the legacy
windows media player, copilot and the bing search taskbar integration.
