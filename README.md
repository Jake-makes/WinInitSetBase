# WinInitSetBase

*This script is intended to be run on every new Windows installation by me and anyone else who wishes to use it.*

## What it does

- **Disables unnecessary processes** that are only needed for Windows Server integration.  
- **Turns off Windows Logon** (when appropriate for the target device).  
- **Removes features** that are better suited for point‑of‑sale (POS) devices.  
- **Uninstalls pre‑installed components** that, in my opinion, should not be present by default, such as:  
  - Legacy Windows Media Player  
  - Copilot  
  - Bing search integration on the taskbar  

These changes streamline the OS, reduce background activity, and give a cleaner base for customized deployments.
